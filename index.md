Annetha, Annetha, you baked your heart out.

You were star baker 0 times.

We met you on 2010-08-17.

After 2 episodes, we said our goodbyes.

Your showstoppers really blew us away:

- Red, White & Blue Chocolate Cake with Cigarellos, Fresh Fruit, and Cream
- Pink Swirl Macarons / Eclairs

And your signature bakes- we want one every Sunday!

- Light Jamaican Black Cakewith Strawberries and Cream
- Rose Petal Shortbread

You brought us great joy, we'll miss you, it's true.

Please keep on baking- without your bakes we'd be blue!
