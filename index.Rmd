```{glue data=send_to}
{baker}, {baker}, you baked your heart out.

You were star baker {star_baker} times.

We met you on {first_date_appeared}.

After {total_episodes_appeared} episodes, we said our goodbyes.
```

Your showstoppers really blew us away:

```{glue data=your_bakes}
- {showstopper}
```

And your signature bakes- we want one every Sunday!

```{glue data=your_bakes}
- {signature}
```

You brought us great joy, we'll miss you, it's true.

Please keep on baking- without your bakes we'd be blue!
